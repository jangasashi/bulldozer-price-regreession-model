    "* **Inputs:** Bulldozer characteristics such as make year, base model, model series, state of sale (e.g. which US state was it sold in), drive system and more.\n",
    "* **Outputs:** Bulldozer sale price (in USD).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're trying to predict a number, this kind of problem is known as a **regression problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "And since we're going to predicting results with a time component (predicting future sales based on past sales), this is also known as a **time series** or **forecasting** problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Every machine learning problem is different** - Since machine learning is such a widespread technology, it can be used for a multitude of different problems. In saying this, there will often be many different ways to approach a problem. In this example, we've focused on predicting a number, which is a regression problem. And since our data had a time component, it could also be considered a time series problem.\n",
    "* **The machine learner's motto: Experiment, experiment, experiment!** - Since there are many different ways to approach machine learning problems, one of the best habits you can develop is an experimental mindset. That means not being afraid to try new things over and over. Because the more things you try, the quicker you can figure what doesn't work and the quicker you can start to move towards what does.\n",
    "* **Always keep the test set separate** - If you can't evaluate your model on unseen data, how would you know how it will perform in the real world on future unseen data? Of course, using a test set isn't a perfect replica of the real world but if it's done right, it can give you a good idea. Because evaluating a model is just as important as training a model.\n",
    "* **If you've trained a model on a data in a certain format, you'll have to make predictions in the same format** - Any preprocessing you do to the training dataset, you'll have to do to the validation, test and custom data. Any computed values should happen on the training set only and then be used to update any subsequent datasets."

    "> **Note:** This may take quite a long time depending on your machine. For example, on my MacBook Pro M1 Pro it took ~10 minutes with `n_estimators=10` (9x lower than what we used for our `best_model`). This is because using `sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder` adds many more features to our dataset (each feature gets turned into an array of 0's and 1's for each unique value). And the more features, the longer it takes to compute and find patterns between them."
